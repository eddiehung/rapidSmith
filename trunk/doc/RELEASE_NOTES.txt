Release Notes for BYU RapidSmith Tools

 - Version 0.1.5 (25 AUG 2010) - 
A few minor bug fixes such as device files now no longer are loaded
repetitively for the same device (this saves a significant amount of
time when loading several designs).  Device files no longer include
speed grade.  Added a recursive delete folder function in the
FileTools class.  The documentation format is better in this release.
